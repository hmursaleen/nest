'''
Ensure that only authenticated users can create, edit, or delete posts. 
This can be enforced using Djangoâ€™s built-in decorators or mixins like 
LoginRequiredMixin and UserPassesTestMixin.

LoginRequiredMixin ensures that only logged-in users can access the view.

UserPassesTestMixin allows you to write custom logic to check whether a 
user has permission to perform a certain action 
(e.g., only the author of a blog post can edit or delete it).

The test_func() method is used in conjunction with UserPassesTestMixin 
to specify the condition that must be met for the user to pass the test.
